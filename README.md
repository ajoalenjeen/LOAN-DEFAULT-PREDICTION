# LOAN-DEFAULT-PREDICTION
## Overview

This project builds an end-to-end loan default prediction model to classify whether a loan will be Fully Paid or Charged Off using borrower financial and credit attributes. The goal is to identify key risk drivers and compare multiple machine learning models using robust evaluation metrics.

## The project covers the complete analytics workflow:

Data preparation and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering and preprocessing

Predictive modeling and hyperparameter tuning

Model evaluation and comparison
